# A form with TS and Express

I made an API with express that catch this form's data! For now it just display the JSON data, but i can really do something with it. <br><br>

The form looks like this:

> with that cool little heart as a button

And when you submit it, your data displays at the screen as JSON, like this:

## How to install

First, you need to clone this repository. Then, inside it, you need to install all the modules that i used, just type:
```console
  npm install
```

after the modules, you must run express' server. To do it just write in you console:

```console
  npm start
```

Then, just execute `index.html` inside `./public/view`, that's easy!

> OBS: If you want to change the code, you need to compile the typescript file. Just use `npm run compile`
